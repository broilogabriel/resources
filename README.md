 - [Structuring Your Project](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/writing/structure/)
 
   >By “structure” we mean the decisions you make concerning how your project best meets its objective. We need to consider how to best leverage Python’s features to create clean, effective code. In practical terms, “structure” means making clean code whose logic and dependencies are clear as well as how the files and folders are organized in the filesystem.

   >Which functions should go into which modules? How does data flow through the project? What features and functions can be grouped together and isolated? By answering questions like these you can begin to plan, in a broad sense, what your finished product will look like.

 - [Pipenv](http://docs.pipenv.org/en/latest/): Sacred Marriage of Pipfile, Pip, & Virtualenv
 
   > Pipenv is an experimental project that aims to bring the best of all packaging worlds to the Python world. It harnesses Pipfile, pip, and virtualenv into one single toolchain. It features very pretty terminal colors.
